Energy consumption is a critical aspect of modern society, as it is directly linked to economic growth and
quality of life. Accurate forecasting of energy demand is crucial for ensuring a reliable supply and meeting
the needs of consumers. However, predicting energy consumption is a challenging task due to the complex
and dynamic nature of energy systems. Traditional forecasting methods often rely on statistical techniques
and historical data, but machine learning algorithms have gained attention in recent years for their ability to
capture complex patterns and relationships in large datasets.
In this context, this study aims to develop and evaluate machine learning-based models for forecasting
energy consumption, with a particular focus on electricity demand. We use publicly available data from
various sources to train and evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms, including
SVM, random forest, and neural networks. Our objective is to compare the accuracy of these models using
various evaluation metrics and identify the most effective approach for energy demand forecasting. By doing
so, we hope to contribute to the development of more reliable and accurate energy forecasting methods that
can support policy-making and investment decisions in the energy sector.
