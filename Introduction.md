# MACHINE LEARNING BASED ENERGY DEMAND FORECASTING FOR SMART ENERGY GRID #

Energy Grid refers to the electric grid, a network of transmission lines, substations, transformers and more that deliver electricity from the power plant to the users.

Energy demand forecasting with machine learning makes the energy grid smarter by leveraging advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to predict future energy consumption patterns more accurately. By analyzing historical energy data, weather patterns, economic indicators, and other relevant factors, machine learning models can identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in energy demand. This enables utilities and grid operators to optimize energy generation, distribution, and resource allocation.

Traditional forecasting methods often rely on statistical techniques and historical data, but machine learning algorithms have ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in large datasets. In this context, this project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning-based models for forecasting energy consumption, with a particular focus on electricity demand. Publicly available data from various sources to train and evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms, including SVM and random forest are used. The objective is to compare the accuracy of these models using various evaluation metrics and identify the most effective approach for energy demand forecasting.

# METHODOLOGY #

In this project, predictive modeling is used to estimate energy demand and daily energy cost based on a dataset collected from Kaggle. The dataset spans three years and includes information on electrical consumption, generation, building pricing, and hourly weather data. Various weather variables serve as predictor variables, while building consumption is the target variable. Exploratory data analysis reveals complete data with few outliers. Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit Learn are employed for data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and regression tasks. Relevant features are identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and data normalization is performed using different scaling techniques. The dataset is split into train and test sets, which are used to train Support Vector Machine and Random Forest regressor models. Hyperparameter tuning is done using an exhaustive grid search. Predictive modeling is then performed on a new dataset containing weather parameters, and predictions for hourly energy consumption are made. The predicted values are converted to a Pandas dataframe, and hourly cost is calculated. Daily resampling and visualizations are created to showcase the predicted energy consumption and cost over time.
